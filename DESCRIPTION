Description: Tools for processing, analyzing, and flagging water quality data 
    from the Cache la Poudre Watershed monitoring network. This package provides 
    functions for data validation, quality control flagging, and summary statistics.
    This network currently deploys In-Situ Inc AquaTroll multiparameter sondes and 
    thus this package is optimized to work with sensor data generated from these 
    instruments and uploaded to In-Situ Inc's cloud service, Hydro Vu.
