\title{pH Linear Model Transformation}
\usage{
cal_lm_pH(df, obs_col, slope_col, offset_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Tibble containing sensor data bounded by two calibrations}

\item{obs_col}{Character string specifying the column name containing pH
observations recorded in HydroVu}

\item{lm_coefs_col}{Character string specifying the column name containing
linear model coefficients with two slope/offset pairs}
}
\description{
Converts pH observations to millivolt units using two-segment linear models
from three-point pH calibration. This function applies forward linear
transformation (pH to mV) to enable subsequent back-calibration processing
in the correct instrumental units. Uses pH value thresholds to select
between low-range and high-range linear segments based on the sensor's
three-point calibration characteristics.
