\title{Apply low-pass binomial filter to reduce sensor noise}
\usage{
low_pass_filter(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing water quality measurements. Must include columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{parameter}: The measurement type (function checks for "Turbidity")
\item \code{mean}: The calculated mean value of measurements to be smoothed
\item \code{DT_round}: Timestamp for temporal alignment (used for rolling window operations)
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as the input, but with an additional
\code{smoothed_mean} column containing the filtered turbidity values. For non-turbidity
parameters, returns the original dataframe unchanged.
}
\description{
Reduces high-frequency noise in turbidity measurements using a 5-point binomial kernel
low-pass filter applied three times in succession. This function specifically addresses
the noise characteristics of optical turbidity sensors, which are prone to rapid
fluctuations due to suspended particles, biofouling, and electronic interference.

The filter uses a binomial kernel with weights [1,4,6,4,1] normalized by dividing by 16, which provides
a Gaussian-like smoothing effect. This kernel gives the greatest influence to the
current measurement, moderate influence to the measurements 15 minutes before and
after, and least influence to the measurements 30 minutes before and after. The
triple application of the filter creates a more aggressive smoothing effect equivalent
to a higher-order binomial filter.

This function currently processes only turbidity data, as turbidity sensors are
particularly susceptible to noise from suspended particles and optical interference.
For other parameters, the function returns the input dataframe unchanged.
