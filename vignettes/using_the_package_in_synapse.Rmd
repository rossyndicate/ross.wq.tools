# 1. Pipeline Overview

The automated quality assurance and quality control (auto-QAQC) pipeline performs these key operations:

-   Data Acquisition: Retrieves raw sensor data from the [HydroVu API](https://www.hydrovu.com/) and field notes from [mWater](https://www.mwater.co/)
-   Pre-processing Data for auto-QAQC Pipeline: Cleans, standardizes, and joins datasets
-   Auto-QAQC Flagging: Applies multiple layers of automated quality checks and flagging
-   Data Integration: Combines new data with historical records
-   Data Management: Creates visualization-ready datasets and archives raw/processed data

# 2. Environment Setup

The Poudre Water Quality Network's auto-QAQC pipeline operates within a structured environment that manages water quality data from collection to analysis. This section explains the key components that make up this environment.

The pipeline is built using the R programming language. It can run both on a local computer or in the cloud using Azure Synapse Analytics. This manual will focus on its use in the Azure Synapse Analytics notebook, which makes up the PWQN auto-QAQC pipeline.

The environment is organized into a directory structure which uses the `Raw` and `Curated` folders in the `fcdlfsdev` folder in the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS) file system that is set in place by FC IT. Generally, the data stored in these folders are:

-   `Raw`: Contains incoming sensor data directly from monitoring stations
-   `Curated`: Stores processed, quality-checked data ready for analysis
-   `Archive` sub-directories: Found in both `Raw` and `Curated` directories and maintain historical versions of both raw and processed data

This pipeline primarily interacts with Parquet and YAML file types which are stored in the mentioned directories. Parquet (.parquet) files are used for efficient data storage for data tables. YAML (.yml) files are used as configuration files for settings and quality thresholds in analysis.

## 2.1 Load Required Libraries

The auto-QAQC pipeline relies on several specialized R packages organized by function:

-   Data Manipulation and Processing:
    -   `{tidyverse}`: Collection of packages for data manipulation and visualization
    -   `{data.table}`: Enhanced data frame for fast data manipulation
    -   `{janitor}`: Tools for data cleaning and tabulation
    -   `{padr}`: Tools for padding time series with missing dates/times
    -   `{zoo}`:Infrastructure for time series data
-   File Handling and Storage:
    -   `{AzureStor}`: Interface to Azure storage services
    -   `{arrow}`: Tools for working with Apache Arrow data
-   String and Time Manipulation:
    -   `{stringr}`: Tools for string manipulation
    -   `{lubridate}`: Tools for working with dates and times
-   Configuration and API Connectivity:
    -   `{yaml}`: Tools for working with YAML configuration files
    -   `{httr2}`: HTTP requests and API interaction
-   Statistical Analysis:
    -   `{RcppRoll}`: Fast rolling functions (window calculations) implemented in C++
-   Custom Functions:
    -   `{ross.wq.tools}`: Custom package for ROSSyndicate management of sonde data, developed from the package `fcw.qaqc`, a custom package for Fort Collins Utilities sonde managment

Together, these packages provide the necessary tools to handle each step of the pipeline: retrieving data from sensors, cleaning and standardizing it, performing statistical analyses for quality control, identifying anomalies, and storing the processed results. The custom {ross.wq.tools} and {fcw.qaqc} package contains specialized functions developed specifically for the unique requirements of the city's Poudre River Water Quality Network.

## 2.2 Define File Paths and Storage Configuration

The auto-QAQC pipeline organizes data storage into a structured file system that keeps both raw and processed data organized. Defining these paths in one place makes the system easier to maintain and helps ensure data flows correctly through each processing step.

As mentioned above, the system uses two primary directory structures:

-   Raw Data Directory (`/Raw/HydroVu/`)
    -   `Incoming`: Temporary location where new sensor data is initially stored
    -   `Archive`: Long-term storage for raw sensor data after processing
    -   `mWaterFieldNotes`: Contains field observations from technicians
    -   `Creds`: Contains HydroVu API credentials
-   Curated Data Directory (`/Curated/HydroVu/`)
    -   Stores quality-controlled, processed data ready for analysis
    -   Contains configuration files needed for quality checks
    -   `complete_archive`: Maintains historical versions of full datasets
    -   `visualization_archive`: Stores ready-to-use data optimized for visualization
-   Archive directories serve several important purposes:
    -   Maintain data history for auditing and verification
    -   Allow recovery if newer processing has issues
    -   Provide historical context for quality control decisions
    -   Support version control (typically keeping the three most recent versions)

The pipeline automatically manages these directories by identifying the most recent files, moving processed raw data to archives, and maintaining the correct number of historical versions. This structured approach ensures data integrity throughout the quality control process.

## 2.3 Setup API Credentials

The auto-QAQC pipeline connects to two external data sources that require authentication:

-   [**HydroVu API**](https://www.hydrovu.com/) - Provides the sensor measurement data
    -   Credentials are stored in a YAML configuration file in the Azure storage system
    -   The file contains a client ID and secret key (similar to a username and password)
    -   The system downloads this file temporarily during processing
    -   These credentials are used to create an authentication token (`hv_token`) that grants access to water quality sensor data
-   [**mWater API**](https://www.mwater.co/) - Provides field technician notes
    -   Uses a simpler authentication approach via a URL that contains embedded access keys
    -   This URL is stored directly in the pipeline code rather than in a separate file

The authentication process follows these steps:

1.  Download the HydroVu credentials file
2.  Extract the client ID and secret key
3.  Use these values to create an authentication token
4.  Store this token for use throughout the pipeline

This approach balances security and convenience for the current operational needs. The credentials file can be updated independently from the pipeline code when needed, and access to the Azure storage system is itself protected.

While more sophisticated security approaches could be implemented in the future (such as Azure Key Vault integration), the current configuration provides appropriate protection while maintaining simplicity for operational use.

# 3. Data Acquisition

The data acquisition phase forms the foundation of the auto-QAQC pipeline by gathering all necessary information to assess water quality. This process combines multiple data sources to create a complete picture of water conditions and sensor performance.

The pipeline begins by loading previously processed historical data to provide context for new measurements. This historical record helps identify trends and anomalies in the incoming data. Next, the system calculates the appropriate time ranges for requesting new data, typically starting from where the last data collection ended to ensure continuous coverage without gaps.

Once time ranges are established, the pipeline connects to the HydroVu API to download raw sensor measurements from monitoring stations along the Poudre River. These measurements include parameters like temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity. Before requesting new data, the system checks and prepares the incoming data directory to ensure proper organization.

After retrieving the sensor data, the pipeline verifies that the acquisition was successful by checking that files were properly created and contain valid data. Any issues during this step would trigger notifications rather than proceeding with incomplete information.

In parallel with sensor measurements, the pipeline also retrieves field technician notes from the mWater system. These notes contain valuable context about sensor maintenance activities, calibration events, and observed environmental conditions. The system extracts two specific types of information from these notes: general observation notes about sensor status and specific records of sensor malfunctions that require special handling during quality control.

Together, these data sources provide both the raw measurements and the contextual information needed for effective quality control in subsequent pipeline stages.

## 3.1 Load Historical Auto-QAQC'd Data

This step retrieves previously processed and quality-controlled data to maintain continuity in the water quality record. Having historical context is essential for detecting trends, identifying anomalies, and making informed decisions about new measurements.

The pipeline first checks if a historical data file exists in the expected location. If found, the system:

1.  Downloads the file from cloud storage to a temporary local location
2.  Reads the file into memory as a structured dataset
3.  Organizes the data by monitoring site and parameter (creating separate datasets for "bellvue-Temperature," "riverbend-pH," etc.)
4.  Removes any empty datasets to streamline processing

If no historical data is found (such as during first-time setup), the system creates an empty starting point. This approach ensures the pipeline can run successfully whether it's the first execution or part of ongoing monitoring.

## 3.2 Determine Time Ranges for HydroVu API Data Request

Before retrieving new water quality data, the pipeline needs to determine the appropriate time period to request. This step ensures continuous data coverage without unnecessary duplication.

The system creates an api_start_dates table that specifies:

-   Which monitoring sites to collect data from

-   What time period to request for each site

To establish these time ranges, the pipeline examines the most recent data already in the system. It specifically looks at Temperature readings (since temperature is consistently measured at all sites) to identify the latest time stamp for each monitoring location.

If historical data exists, the system sets start times to begin immediately after the most recent measurements. This creates a seamless continuation of the water quality record.

If no historical data is available (such as during initial setup), the system applies default start dates based on the current monitoring season.

This approach ensures efficient data collection by:

-   Preventing gaps in the monitoring record
-   Avoiding duplicate data that would require reconciliation
-   Customizing time ranges for each monitoring site based on its specific history

The resulting time ranges are used in the subsequent steps to retrieve precisely the data needed to maintain the continuous water quality record.

## 3.3 Request and Upload HydroVu API Data

After determining the appropriate time ranges, the pipeline retrieves raw sensor measurements from the HydroVu API. This is the primary data collection step that gathers the core water quality parameters needed for analysis.

The system begins by preparing a clean working directory, moving any existing files to an archive location to prevent confusion between old and new data. This preparation ensures each processing run starts with a clear workspace.

Once prepared, the pipeline systematically retrieves data for each monitoring site along the Poudre River. It filters out irrelevant data sources (CSU manages multiple In-Situ sonde networks) and makes targeted API requests for each location, saving the results as individual files. The process includes comprehensive logging of each request to maintain a record of data collection activities.

After retrieval attempts are complete, the system verifies that files were successfully created. This critical verification step prevents the pipeline from proceeding with missing or incomplete data, which could lead to inaccurate water quality assessments. If no data is retrieved, the pipeline stops execution and alerts operators to investigate potential connection or data availability issues.

### 3.3.1 Check and Prepare Incoming Data Directory

Before retrieving new data, the pipeline ensures the incoming directory is properly prepared. This step prevents confusion between old and new data files during processing.

The system first checks if any files already exist in the incoming data directory. If the directory is empty, processing continues normally.

If files are found (perhaps from a previous incomplete run), the pipeline:

1.  Moves these existing files to an archive location for safekeeping
2.  Verifies the directory was successfully cleared
3.  Only proceeds when the directory is confirmed empty

This preparation step prevents data mixups and ensures each processing run starts with a clean working environment starting at the appropriate time stamp.

### 3.3.2 Request and Upload Water Quality Data from HydroVu API

Once the environment is prepared, the pipeline retrieves new water quality measurements from each monitoring site. The system:

1.  Identifies all monitoring locations along the Poudre River
2.  Filters out irrelevant sites not part of the FC sonde network
3.  For each site, requests data for the specific time period determined earlier
4.  Saves each site's data as separate files in the incoming directory

The data retrieval uses the previously created authentication token to access the secured API. The system logs each request with details about which site is being processed and the time range requested, creating a record of the data collection process.

### 3.3.3 Verify Successful Data Retrieval from HydroVu

After attempting to retrieve data, the pipeline verifies that files were actually created. This verification step ensures that the process doesn't continue with missing or incomplete data.

The system checks if any files exist in the incoming directory. If files are found, it confirms successful data retrieval and continues processing.

If no files were created, the pipeline immediately stops with an error message. This halt prevents downstream processing errors and alerts operators to investigate potential issues with either API connection problems or changes in the API's data structure.

This verification ensures the integrity of the water quality monitoring process by only proceeding when valid data is available.

## 3.4 Request and Load mWater Data

While sensor measurements provide the core water quality data, field technician notes are equally important for understanding the context around these measurements. The pipeline retrieves these field notes from mWater, a mobile data collection platform.

The system first attempts to retrieve fresh field notes directly from the mWater API. If this connection is successful, the newly retrieved data is also saved as a cached file with a timestamp for future reference.

If the API connection fails for any reason, the pipeline automatically falls back to using the most recently cached field notes. This redundancy ensures that field context is always available for data processing, even when network connectivity issues occur.

This approach balances having the most up-to-date field information with resilience against potential connection problems.

### 3.4.1 Extract Sensor Observation Notes from mWater Data

Once the field notes are available, the pipeline extracts general observations about sensor operations. These notes include:

-   Routine maintenance activities
-   Sensor cleaning records
-   Calibration events
-   Equipment changes
-   General site conditions

This information helps explain patterns in the data that might otherwise appear anomalous. For example, a sudden change in readings might be explained by a calibration event rather than an actual environmental change.

### 3.4.2 Extract Sensor Malfunction Notes from mWater Data

The pipeline also specifically extracts records of sensor malfunctions from the field notes. These malfunction records document periods when:

-   Sensors were physically damaged
-   Electronic components failed
-   Sensors were buried in sediment
-   Biofouling affected readings
-   Other technical issues occurred

The system separates these malfunction notes from general observations because they require special handling during quality control. Data collected during known malfunction periods may need to be excluded entirely or heavily flagged in the final dataset.

# 4. Preprocessing Data for Auto-QAQC Pipeline

The preprocessing phase transforms raw API sensor data into a standardized format ready for quality control analysis. This step organizes measurements by monitoring location and parameter type, standardizes timestamps to UTC, calculates summary statistics, and integrates field observations to provide context for subsequent quality checks.

## 4.1 Load Raw HydroVu Data into Notebook Environment

The system imports raw API sensor data files from the incoming directory and organizes them into a structured dataset accessible for processing.

## 4.2 Tidy Raw HydroVu Data

Raw sensor data is organized into standardized 15-minute intervals with consistent formatting across all monitoring sites and parameters.

## 4.3 Combine Tidied HydroVu Data with Historical Data Subset and Field Notes

The newly processed data is merged with relevant historical data and enriched with field technician observations to provide context for quality analysis.

## 4.4 Generate Summary Statistics for the Pre-processed Data

For each site-parameter combination, the system calculates contextual statistics like rolling averages, medians, and rate-of-change (slope) metrics used in subsequent quality checks.

# 5. Auto-QAQC Flagging

The flagging process is the core of the quality control system, applying multiple layers of checks to identify potential data quality issues. The pipeline uses a hierarchical approach that progresses from individual parameter assessments to site-level relationships and finally to network-wide patterns.

## 5.1 Read in Thresholds for Flagging

Before quality checks can be performed, the system loads reference thresholds that define acceptable measurement ranges based on both sensor specifications and expected environmental conditions.

### 5.1.1 Sensor Specification Thresholds

Manufacturer-defined operating ranges for each sensor type establish the fundamental physical limitations of the measurement equipment.

### 5.1.2 Sensor Specific Seasonal Thresholds

We created expected value ranges for each parameter by season and location. This was done through historical analysis paired with expert knowledge of the Poudre River.

Each sensor's seasonal thresholds were established via historical data analysis of the 2023 field campaign's sensor data. If data quantity or quality created an issue in creating these thresholds, they were established manually through expert knowledge of the system. As more data is verified and the quantity/quality issues continue to improve, those manually established thresholds can be updated.

## 5.2 Individual-Parameter Quality Checks

The first layer of quality control examines each parameter independently:

-   Field visit flags: Marks data collected during or shortly after technician site visits when sensors may have been disturbed.
-   Specification range flags: Identifies values outside manufacturer-specified operating ranges for each sensor.
-   Seasonal range flags: Highlights measurements outside statistically normal ranges for the specific season and location.
-   Missing data flags: Marks gaps in the continuous monitoring record.
-   DO noise flags: Identifies unusual fluctuations in dissolved oxygen that may indicate sensor interference.
-   Repeated value flags: Flags suspicious instances where the exact same value appears in consecutive readings.
-   Depth shift flags: Marks periods when the sensor depth position changed.
-   Sensor drift flags: Identifies progressive shifts in optical sensor readings that may indicate biofouling.

## 5.3 Site-Level (Intra-sonde) Quality Checks

The second layer examines relationships between different parameters at the same time:

-   Frozen water flags: Marks all parameters when water temperature is at or below freezing.
-   Intersensor check flags: Removes redundant slope violation flags when temperature or depth changes explain rapid rises of plummets.
-   Sonde burial flags: Identifies periods when persistent DO interference suggests the entire monitoring unit was buried in sediment.
-   Unsubmerged sonde flags: Marks periods when depth readings indicate the sensors were not fully underwater.
-   Known sensor malfunction flags: Applies information from field technician reports about known sonde or sensor issues.

## 5.4 Network-Wide (Inter-sonde) Quality Checks

The third layer analyzes patterns across the entire monitoring network:

-   Network-wide event flags: Removes flags from changes that appear at multiple sites simultaneously, indicating real environmental events rather than sensor issues.
-   Suspect data flags: Marks data points surrounded by flagged observations that might be part of the same quality issue.
-   Isolated flag removal: Eliminates standalone "suspect data" flags that aren't part of larger patterns of concern.

## 5.5 List of all flags in the Auto-QAQC Pipeline

***Field Activity Flags***

1.  **"sonde not employed"** - Applied to periods when the sensor was physically removed from the water body (indicated by sonde_employed = 1 in field notes).

2.  **"site visit"** - Applied to exact timestamps when field technicians were actively working with the equipment on site.

3.  **"sv window"** - Applied to a buffer period around site visits (15 minutes before and 60 minutes after) when data may be affected by field activities.

***Depth and Submersion Flags***

4.  **"possible burial"** - Applied to all parameters when the dissolved oxygen (DO) sensor shows evidence of sonde burial in sediment over an extended period (24+ hours of DO interference).

5.  **"sonde moved"** - Applied when there is evidence that sondes were physically moved or repositioned in their housings, which can cause discontinuities in the data.

6.  **"sonde unsubmerged"** - Applied when the depth sensor readings indicate the sonde was not fully submerged in water (relative_depth ≤ 0).

***Parameter-Specific Flags***

7.  **"do interference"** - Applied to dissolved oxygen measurements when there are sudden fluctuations or when DO is abnormally low (≤ 5 mg/L), potentially indicating sensor issues or environmental disturbances.

8.  **"frozen"** - Applied to all parameters when water temperature is at or below freezing (0°C), as measurements are likely affected by ice formation.

9.  **"outside of sensor specification range"** - Applied when measurements fall outside the manufacturer's specified operating ranges for a sensor.

10. **"outside of seasonal range"** - Applied when measurements fall outside the 1st-99th percentile range of historical measurements for that site, parameter, and season.

11. **"slope violation"** - Applied when the rate of change between consecutive measurements exceeds historical thresholds for that parameter and season.

12. **"drift"** - Applied to optical sensors (FDOM Fluorescence, Turbidity, Chl-a Fluorescence) when they show evidence of progressive drift over time, indicating potential biofouling or calibration issues.

***Data Quality Flags***

13. **"missing data"** - Applied to rows where measurements are missing (NA values).

14. **"repeated value"** - Applied when a measurement has exactly the same value as either the preceding or following measurement, which can indicate sensor malfunction.

15. **"suspect data"** - Applied in two scenarios:

-   When an unflagged measurement falls within a 2-hour window where ≥50% of surrounding data points have quality flags

-   When an isolated measurement appears within a 2-hour window where ≥90% of surrounding data is missing

***Maintenance and Malfunction Flags***

16. **"reported sonde burial"** - Applied based on field technician notes indicating that the sonde was buried in sediment.

17. **"reported sensor biofouling"** - Applied based on field technician notes indicating biofouling, grime, or drift issues.

18. **"reported depth calibration malfunction"** - Applied when field notes indicate improper level calibration.

19. **"reported sonde unsubmerged"** - Applied when field notes indicate the sonde was not properly submerged.

20. **"reported sensor malfunction"** - A general flag applied when field notes indicate sensor malfunction not covered by the more specific categories.

21. **"calibration fix"** - Applied to measurements that have been corrected due to identified calibration issues.

## 5.6 Final Curated Data Product

This step also selects the final columns that will be stored for analysis:

-   `DT_round`: Rounded timestamp defining each time interval of 15-minutes
-   `DT_join`: A string version of `DT_round` for joining purposes
-   `site`: Monitoring location identifier (e.g., "bellvue", "salyer")
-   `parameter`: Measurement type (e.g., "Temperature", "DO")
-   `mean`: Average value for the 15-minute interval
-   `units`: Measurement units (e.g., "°C", "mg/L")
-   `n_obs`: Number of observations averaged in each 15-minute interval, almost always 1.
-   `spread`: Range of values within the 15-minute interval (max - min), almost always 0
-   `auto_flag`: Contains auto-generated flags where network-wide events have been accounted for
-   `mal_flag`: Contains field note-based sonde malfunction flags for affected measurements
-   `sonde_moved`: Contains "sonde moved" flags for affected measurements
-   `historical`: Indicates whether the observation is from historically quality controlled data.

# 6. Data Integration and Management

After quality control processing is complete, the pipeline integrates new data into the historical record and creates specialized datasets for different uses. This phase also manages the data lifecycle, maintaining appropriate archives while preventing unnecessary file accumulation.

## 6.1 Combine with Historical Dataset

The pipeline merges newly processed and flagged data with the existing historical record to create a comprehensive, continuous dataset. The final_data_binder function handles this integration, maintaining continuity while incorporating the latest quality assessments. This function is careful to preserve data context and ensures that overlapping data periods are handled appropriately, with newer quality assessments taking precedence over older ones. All records are marked as "historical" once integrated, establishing a clean baseline for the next processing cycle.

## 6.2 Save Complete Dataset

The complete quality-controlled dataset is saved in two locations to ensure data security and accessibility. First, the system saves the dataset to a temporary local file, then uploads it to the main curated data folder with a timestamped filename (e.g., "`AutoQAQCPWQN20250423-T154432Z.parquet`"). A duplicate copy is also saved to a dedicated archive folder, providing redundancy if the main file is accidentally modified or deleted. This approach ensures the complete water quality record is preserved while maintaining clear version identification through consistent timestamp-based naming conventions.

## 6.3 Create Visualization Dataset

For analysis and visualization purposes, the pipeline creates a streamlined dataset containing only the most recent 45 days of data. This visualization dataset is filtered from the complete historical record and saved with a distinct filename pattern (e.g., "`AutoQAQCPWQNvisualizer20250423-T154432Z.parquet`"). By maintaining a separate, time-limited dataset, the system improves performance for dashboard applications and current condition monitoring without requiring users to process the entire historical record. Like the complete dataset, this visualization file is saved both in the main curated folder and in a dedicated archive location.

## 6.4 Manage File Retention

To prevent unconstrained growth of storage requirements, the pipeline implements an automated file retention policy. In the main curated folder, only the most recent version of each dataset type (complete and visualization) is retained, with older versions automatically deleted. In the archive folders, the system preserves the three most recent versions of each dataset type, providing a balance between historical preservation and storage efficiency. This retention policy is managed by sorting files by their embedded timestamps and selectively removing older files that exceed the retention count, ensuring consistent and predictable storage utilization over time.

## 6.5 Archive Raw Data Files

Once processing is complete, the raw data files in the incoming directory are moved to a dedicated archive location. This step ensures that the original, unmodified sensor data is preserved for future reference or reprocessing if needed, while keeping the incoming directory clear for the next data collection cycle. The system verifies that files are successfully transferred to the archive before removing them from the incoming directory, preventing accidental data loss. This archiving step completes the data lifecycle management process, maintaining a clean separation between active processing and historical storage.
